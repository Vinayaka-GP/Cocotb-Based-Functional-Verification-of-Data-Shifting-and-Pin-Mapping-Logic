# Cocotb-Based-Functional-Verification-of-Data-Shifting-and-Pin-Mapping-Logic
This repository contains a cocotb-based verification environment developed to validate multi-lane data shifting and pin mapping logic. The testbench applies clock-driven stimulus, performs self-checking assertions, and measures functional coverage to ensure deterministic output behavior. Verification results are validated using waveform analysis and coverage closure.
