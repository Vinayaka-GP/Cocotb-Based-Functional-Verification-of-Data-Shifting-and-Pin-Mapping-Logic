# Cocotb-Based-Functional-Verification-of-Data-Shifting-and-Pin-Mapping-Logic
Implemented a Python-based cocotb testbench to verify multi-lane data shifting and pin-level mapping logic. Developed self-checking assertions, clock-driven stimulus, and functional coverage to ensure deterministic output behavior across cycles. Verified correctness using waveform analysis and coverage closure.
